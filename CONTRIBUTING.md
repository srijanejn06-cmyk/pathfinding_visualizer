Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pathfinding Visualizer!

How to contribute

- Bug reports: Open an issue with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and browser/OS details.
- Feature requests: Open an issue and explain the motivation and a short design idea.
- Pull requests: Fork the repo, create a branch, make changes, run locally to test, and submit a PR.

Local development

1. Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser (or run a local static server).
2. Make your changes and ensure the app still loads and the grid behaves as expected.

Code style

- Plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Keep changes small and focused.
- Add tests or instructions for manual verification if the change affects behavior.

Thanks â€” maintainers will review PRs and issues as time permits.
